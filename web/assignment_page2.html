    <p style="color:thistle;">More than 3,600 people with the coronavirus have now died in the <i>United States</i>, according to a <b> New York Times database</b>,

    in mainland China, where the pandemic started in December.</p>

    <p style="color:thistle;">That sort of unlikely exchange happens all the time in <a href="https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/" style="color:whitesmoke;">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, a cheerful and funny
    video game for the Nintendo Switch that has become a social-media sensation in the era of social distancing. The premise is simple: You're tasked with transforming
    a small, cartoony island into a bustling village. There is no kidnapped princess or planet on the brink of war, but you get to go outside, which is even better.</p>
